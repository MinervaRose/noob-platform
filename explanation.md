Sure. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code for the simple platform video game in Python that I showed you:
Python

import pygame

# Define constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
GRAVITY = 9.81

Use code with caution. Learn more

The first line imports the Pygame library, which is a Python library for creating video games. The next three lines define constants for the screen width, screen height, and gravity.
Python

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line initializes the Pygame library.
Python

# Create the game window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line creates the game window using the screen width and height constants that we defined earlier.
Python

# Load the player sprite
player = pygame.image.load("player.png")

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line loads the player sprite image.
Python

# Create a sprite group for the player
player_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
player_group.add(player)

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line creates a sprite group for the player. A sprite group is a collection of sprites that can be managed and updated together.
Python

# Create a sprite group for the platforms
platform_group = pygame.sprite.Group()

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line creates a sprite group for the platforms.
Python

# Create the first platform
platform = pygame.sprite.Sprite()
platform.image = pygame.Surface((100, 20))
platform.image.fill((0, 255, 0))
platform.rect = platform.image.get_rect()
platform.rect.x = 100
platform.rect.y = 300
platform_group.add(platform)

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line creates the first platform sprite. We set the platform's image to a green rectangle, and we set its position to (100, 300). We then add the platform to the platform sprite group.
Python

# Create the game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

Use code with caution. Learn more

This line creates a game clock. The game clock will be used to limit the framerate of the game.
Python

# Game loop
while True:

    # Check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # Update the player's position
    player.rect.y += GRAVITY
    if player.rect.colliderect(platform.rect):
        player.rect.y = platform.rect.top - player.rect.height

    # Check for collisions with platforms
    for platform in platform_group:
        if player.rect.colliderect(platform.rect):
            player.rect.y = platform.rect.top - player.rect.height

    # Draw the game window
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    player_group.draw(screen)
    platform_group.draw(screen)
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Limit the framerate
    clock.tick(60)

The game loop is where the main game logic goes. This loop will run forever, or until the player quits the game.

The first thing we do in the game loop is check for events. This means that we check to see if the player has pressed any keys or clicked the mouse. If the player has pressed the quit button, we quit the game.

Next, we update the player's position. We do this by adding gravity to the player's y-position. If the player is colliding with a platform, we set the player's y-position to just above the platform.

We then check for collisions with platforms. If the player is colliding with a platform, we set the player's y-position to just above the platform.

Finally, we draw the game window and limit the framerate.

This is just a very basic example, of course. You can add more features, such as different levels, enemies, and power-ups, to make your game more complex and challenging.
